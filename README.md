# Aeronautical Cube

3D Flappy Bird

Originally named Humzah Bird, after a friend of mine.
It was changed to Aeronautical Cube after my artistic skill prevented me from being able to 3D model anything other than a cube.

It was made to learn more about SceneKit and how it could interact with SwiftUI.
